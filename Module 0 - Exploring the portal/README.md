# Module - 0. Exploring the portal
In this module we will see the different parts that form the portal and which of them we are going to use. The idea is to familiarize with it and highlight the most important ones.
## Left-hand side menu
Here we can find all of the sections of the Power BI Service. What do they do for us?
* Favourites: we can add dashboards, reports and databases to that section to enable quick acces to our most used resources.
* Recent: here you can find all of the activity of the choosen workspace.
* Applications: we won't focus on this section but the main objective, but it is used to packetize Power BI resources, such as dashboards, reports or data and this could be exported to a customer's Power BI Service.
* Shared with me: all of the content shared in your company related to Power BI is in this blade.
* Workspaces: The content in Power BI is organized in workspaces. This enables you to classify all of your works for example in departments of teams.

## Create a workspace
If you have started this lab with other mates of your company, you can create a unique workspace and all of you could be working on that workspace. It is recomended to start using the sharing options because it is one of the most powerful features of Power BI.
Go to the left-hand side menu, click on Workspaces and select Create app workspace. A new blade will appear on the right hand. Write a name group and an ID. Remember that the ID must be unique.

Then set the workspace to private in order to share the content only with the people that you want. In the next option click on the option that enables the other participants of the dashboard to not only view the content, but edit it as well.
And finally add the members of your team. Right after that, a new workshop appears in the left-hand side of the portal

Invited members of the workshop will receive an e-mail with a link to the new workshop

### Datasets
Here are the data that you can import to the Power BI Service or connect from other sources. You can connect different kind of data (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-get-data/).
So now we can import a Dataset. Go to the button "Get Data", and select the xmls file that you can find in this module. Then go to the section Files and click again in Get. Now click in Local File, find it and finally click in import Excel into Power BI if we want o create some graphs with it. The other option is just for visualizing the Excel in a Workbook. 

## Reports
This is one or more pages of visualizations (charts, graphs, treemaps and many many more). All of the visualizations on a report come from a single dataset. You can create a report from the scratch or a collegue can share a report with you. The other members of the workshop will see the same databases and they can start working with it from their own dasboard. One report can be associated with multiple dashboards

## Dashboards
A dashboard is something you create or something a colleague creates and shares with you. It is a single canvas that contains zero or more tiles and widgets. Each tile displays a single visualization that was created from a dataset and pinned to the dashboard.

## Q&A question box.
If you click in the dashboard you've just created importing the dataset, you can make queries in natural language, for example, you can ask:

## Quick Insights
First of all, we need to know what the HoL is about, and the best way to do that is taking a look to the dataset. Please open the Excel and see the type of columns that we have.
We can also see some graphs or statistics from the portal. From the left-side bar, click in the workspace - DATASETS, and click in the three dots next to the dataset name. A new blade will appear. Select VIWE INSIGHTS. Wait a few seconds and you'll see some interesting graphs that Power BI make for you without teaching it anything. 
Ok so in this dataset we can see statistics about sales of products, sold in Canada. We have several information, such as the Product ID, the province where it is sold, the revenue produced for that sell, units sold there and when whas it sold.
