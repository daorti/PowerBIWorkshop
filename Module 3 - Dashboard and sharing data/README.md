# Dashboard and sharing data
In this module you will learn how to pin tiles to a dashboard, and share it within your organization. Let's see how we can do that.

## Dashboard
Open the report that we have just created and select the pin icon of any chart. It is in the top-right corner of the chart. A new dialog will appear. Select *Existing dashboard*, because when we imported the data, an empty dashboard was created.

Go to the dashboard and you'll see the chart there. Pin more in order to make a rich dashboard. Try to change the format in orther to make them more visual. We can even pin a Youtube video. From the dashboard tab, clic on *Add tile*, in the top-rigt menu, and then select *VIDEO*. Put the URL and now you have a new tile with the Youtube video embebbed.

So now you must have a dashboard quite similar to this:

On the top-right corner of each tile you can click on the focus mode, this alows you to see deeper detailes of the chart.
