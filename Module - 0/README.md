# Module - 0. Exploring the portal
In this module we will see the different parts that form the portal and which of them we are going to use. The idea is to familiarize with it and highlight the most important ones.
## Left-hand side menu
Here we can find all of the sections of the Power BI Service. What do they do for us?
* Favourites: we can add dashboards, reports and databases to that section to enable quick acces to our most used resources.
* Recent: here you can find all of the activity of the choosen workspace.
* Applications: we won't focus on this section but the main objective, but it is used to packetize Power BI resources, such as dashboards, reports or data and this could be exported to a customer's Power BI Service.
* Shared with me: all of the content shared in your company related to Power BI is in this blade.
* Workspaces: The content in Power BI is organized in workspaces. This enables you to classify all of your works for example in departments of teams.
