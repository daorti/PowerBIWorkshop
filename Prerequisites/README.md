# Prerequisites
In this lab we won't need any software, so you don't have to worry about downloading anything because you can make the exercises online, from the Power BI portal. You will only use the Power BI Service, so you just need an Office 365 account and your favourite browser.

Power BI requires you to use a work, or school email address to sign up. It does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers, such as outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com and others.

If you already have an Office 365 account, go directly to the section *Sign up in the Power BI portal*, below. If that is not the case, continue with the next step.


## How can I get an Office 356 account?
As you already know, you will need a corporate or a school email if you want to sign up in Power BI Service. Power BI is one of the services offered by Office 356, so first of all you'll need to sign up in Office 365. Here you have two options, the student or the business account.

### Student account
If you are a student, follow this guidelines:

Go to the [registration page here](https://signup.microsoft.com/signup/). You will see this screen:

Follow the registration steps.

## Sign up in the Power BI portal
So now that we have an Office 356 account, it is necessary to sign up in the Power BI Service. Go to the [Power BI Service Portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) and click in *Get started free*.

Fill all of the information for the registration and remember that a verification code is required. Check your inbox for the verification code. If you can't find it, it might be in the spam folder.

# Sign in
So now we can access to the Power BI Service. Go to the portal [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/), click in the tab *Sign in* and enter your Office 365 credentials.

# The language
All of the HoL is in english, so if your Office 365 acount is configured in other language, I recommend you to change it only for the Power BI portal, because it would be easier to find all of the tabs, options and sections. Go to the settings wheel, then *Configuration* and select the language.
